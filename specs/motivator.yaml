motivatorEndpoints:
  get:
    summary: Get motivators for authenticated user
    operationId: motivator:get
    description: |-
      This endpoint returns all motivators that should be available to the user in the frontend.

      A *motivator* is a generic exercise, that displays different type of contexts and eventually offers input elements. 
    responses:
      '200':
        description: |-
          OK. A list of avaiable motivator exercises for the currently authenticated user is returned.

          The content to display is presented in `content` as ordered array. Each element should be displayed in the order of occurence in the array.

          If a content object has the type input, it returns an `id` of an input object presented in `inputs`. Each input object offers one or more so called fields. A field is an individual, configurable input type. You can think of an input as a HTML form, which also consists out of multiple input elements and then submits all user inputs to the server.

          See the `POST /motivator/result` endpoint on how to send user inputs to the server.

motivatorResultEndpoints:
  post:
    summary: Add a new result to user's current motivator.
    operationId: motivator:result:add
    description: |-
      This endpoint submits a users result on a motivator exercise.

      A result is basically an array of collected users inputs according to the motivator specification provided by the `GET /motivator` endpoint.

      The user can also submit optional feedback on a motivator with a result response. As collection of free-text comments as part of an evaluation is very sensitive in terms of privacy, this version of the API does not include such an option.

      On success, the endpoint returns a `201 Created` response, with the body containing the `id` of the motivator result and a new `state` for the motivator exercises, as a motivator could consist out of multiple parts. If the return value indicates that a motivator is not fully completed, you should call the `GET` endpoint again, as the content the motivator could have changed.

      If the motivator does not exists or is not available for the current user, a `404 Not Found` response is returned.

      If the validation of the request body against the specified schema fails, or does not match the actual inputs of the motivator, a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response is returned, with the body containing an `error` string with further information.
    parameters:
      - name: motivatorId
        in: path
        schema:
          $ref: '../schemas/motivator.yaml#/MotivatorId'

          The `id` of the motivator you want to add a result for.
    requestBody:
      description: |-
        The result to submit on the motivator. 
        
        The `values` property acts as a dictionary, containing the IDs referenced in the `input` object in the motivator content. 
        
        The coressponding value, again is a dictionary of mapping the reference string to objects containing a single `value` property. 
        
        The type of `value` depends on the individual input type.
